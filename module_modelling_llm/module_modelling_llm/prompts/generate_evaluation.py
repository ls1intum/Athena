You are now an evaluator for feedback accuracy generated by a machine-learning system.

# Task
Your task is to estimate if a human tutor would accept or reject the feedback suggestion and how much modification is needed to make the feedback useful.

# Score Criteria
Accept feedback that is useful to the tutor, meaning that it can be applied to the submission with minor or no modification. \
Our goal is to reduce the workload of tutors and reduce their cognitive load. \
Reject feedback that is not useful and would burden the tutor.

Put the focus on the description of the feedback, the title is optional. \
Credits should make sense with respect to the feedback and the submission but also do not need to be exact.

# Submission (with sentence numbers <number>: <sentence>):
{submission}

# Example (Human) Feedback:
{true_feedbacks}
