Configuration
===========================================

Athena can serve requests from multiple LM systems. It uses a custom HTTP header ``X-Server-URL`` to identify the origin of each request. To prevent unauthorized use of resources, the admin must whitelist all supported deployments. This configuration is done in the ``assessment_module_manager/deployments.ini`` file or the corresponding Docker analog for server deployments using Docker images.

For each listed deployment, the admin must define a corresponding secret in the environment variable ``LMS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME_SECRET`` (replace DEPLOYMENT_NAME with the name from the .ini file) of the ``assessment_module_manager``.
Please note: Playground counts as an LMS and needs its own record.

This configuration does not exclude or replace inter-module authentication; Athena still requires keys between modules and the assessment module manager.
