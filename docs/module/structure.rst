Structure of a Module
===========================================

An Athena Module must provide functionality by using the provided Python decorators from the ``athena`` package.
A module essentially just provides a set of functions that are called by the Athena framework. Any decorated function accessible through the ``__main__.py`` entry point of the module will be called by the framework. You can however only have exactly one function per decorator.

Typical File Structure
----------------------
You can see a typical module file structure in the provided ``module_example`` in this repository.

.. code-block:: text

    module_example
    ├── module_example
    │   └── __main__.py
    ├── .env
    ├── docker-compose.yml
    ├── pyproject.toml
    ├── poetry.lock
    └── README.md

Explanation of the files:

- ``module_example``: Your Python package. It is necessary that the name is the same as the name of the directory, because this is the only way that the resulting Python package can be imported with the proper name.
- ``module_example/__main__.py``: The entry point of your module. This is the file that will be executed by the Athena framework. It must contain or import the decorated functions that you want to use.
- ``.env``: The environment file for the module. It contains the environment variables that are passed to the module. See the section on environment variables for more information.
- ``docker-compose.yml``: The docker-compose file for the module. It contains the configuration for the docker container that will be used to run the module. You can add additional services here, which will be available to the module. The required minimum is a ``main`` service that runs the module.
- ``pyproject.toml``: The poetry configuration file for the module. It contains the dependencies of the module. You can add additional dependencies here by using the ``poetry add`` command.
- ``poetry.lock``: The poetry lock file for the module. It contains the exact versions of the dependencies of the module. You should not edit this file manually. You should however commit it to your repository.
- ``README.md``: The readme file for the module with additional information about the module.

Available Decorators
--------------------
The following decorators are available. Typically, the respective functions are called in the order as they are listed here.

Consume Submissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get submissions for an exercise. This function is usually called when the exercise deadline is reached in the LMS. The module for the exercise will receive the submissions at the function annotated with ``@submission_consumer``.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        from athena import *

        @submissions_consumer
        def receive_submissions(exercise: Exercise, submissions: List[Submission]):
            ...

Select Submission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Select the submission to grade next out out of many submissions. The LMS would usually call this right before a tutor can start grading a submission. You should get a list of all submissions that are not graded yet. The module will receive the request at the function annotated with ``@submission_selector``.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        from athena import *

        @submission_selector
        def select_submission(exercise: Exercise, submissions: List[Submission]) -> Submission:
            ...
            # Do something with the submissions and return the one that should be assessed next
            # This example always chooses the first submission
            return submissions[0]

Consume Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get a list of given feedback. This usually happens when someone gives feedback on the submission in the LMS. The module will receive the feedback at the function annotated with ``@feedback_consumer``.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        from athena import *

        @feedback_consumer
        def process_incoming_feedback(exercise: Exercise, submission: Submission, feedbacks: List[Feedback]):
            ...

Provide Feedback Suggestions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get a list of feedback suggestions for a submission. Then provide a list of suggestions for feedback. The LMS would usually call this when a tutor starts grading a submission. The module will receive the request at the function annotated with ``@feedback_provider``.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        from athena import *

        @feedback_provider
        def suggest_feedback(exercise: Exercise, submission: Submission) -> List[Feedback]:
            # Do something with the submission and return a list of feedback suggestions
            ...
            return [
                Feedback(
                    ...
                )
            ]

Provide Config Schema (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get a schema for config options of the module as json schema. The config complying to the schema can then be provided in the header of a request `X-Module-Config` to override the default values. The module can decorate one pydantic model with ``@config_schema_provider`` to provide the schema and should have default values set for all fields as default configuration. The configuration class can be appended to the function signature of all other decorators to provide the configuration to the function.

Example:
    .. code-block:: python

        from athena import *

        @config_schema_provider
        class Configuration(BaseModel):
            debug: bool = Field(False, description="Whether the module is in debug mode.")
            ...

Provide Evaluation (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Get an arbitrary evaluation for a submission with historical ``true_feedback`` and feedback suggestions ``predicted_feedback``. The Playground would usually call this when conducting an evaluation during an experiment. The module will receive the request at the function annotated with ``@evaluation_provider``.

If you want to have the ``/evaluation`` endpoint available during the Playground evaluation mode, you need to set ``supports_evaluation = true`` in the ``modules.ini`` and ``modules.docker.ini`` files.

Example: 
    .. code-block:: python

        from athena import *

        @evaluation_provider
        def evaluate_feedback(exercise: Exercise, submission: Submission, true_feedbacks: List[Feedback], predicted_feedbacks: List[Feedback]) -> Any:
            # Do something with the true and predicted feedback and return the evaluation result
            ...
            # Example: Generate some example evaluation result
            evaluation_results = []
            true_feedback_embeddings = [random.random() for _ in true_feedbacks] 
            predicted_feedback_embeddings = [random.random() for _ in predicted_feedbacks]
            for feedback, embedding in zip(predicted_feedbacks, predicted_feedback_embeddings):
                feedback_evaluation = {
                    "feedback_id": feedback.id,
                    "embedding": embedding,
                    "has_match": len([t for t in true_feedback_embeddings if abs(t - embedding) < 0.1]) > 0,
                    "correctness": random.random()
                }
                evaluation_results.append(feedback_evaluation)
            ...
            # Return arbitrary evaluation results
            return evaluation_results

Environment Variables
---------------------
You should provide at least the following environment variables for your module to work properly:

- ``MODULE_NAME``: The name of the module. This is used to identify the module in the LMS. It has to exactly match the name of the module directory.
- ``MODULE_TYPE``: The type of exercises that the module supports, e.g. ``text`` or ``programming``.
- ``PORT``: A unique port for the module to run on. This is used to prevent conflicts when running multiple modules on the same machine. We suggest counting up from ``5001`` (which is the example module).
- ``PRODUCTION``: 0 or 1, depending on whether the module is running in production mode or not. If the value is 0, the module will auto-reload on changes.

- ``COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=athena_${MODULE_NAME}``: Keep this as-is. Is it used to scope the docker service names.
