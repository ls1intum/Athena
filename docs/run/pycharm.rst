From PyCharm
===========================================

This repository provides existing run configurations for PyCharm.
You can use them to run Athena in PyCharm.

To test a module, you need to start two run configurations:

- `Assessment Module Manager`: This will start the module manager
- `Module <some module name>`: This will start the module you want to test
- You can also start more modules via their respective run configurations

You can also start any of the run configurations in Debug Mode, to use breakpoints and step through the code.

The assessment module manager API will be available at http://localhost:5100.
