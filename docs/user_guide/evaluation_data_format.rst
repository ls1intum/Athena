Evaluation Data Format
===========================

This document describes the structure of the evaluation data format used in Athena. It covers various exercise types, their submissions, and feedback types. The following sections provide detailed explanations and examples.

Exercise Data Structure
=======================

Each exercise is represented as a JSON object with the following fields:

- **id**: Unique identifier for the exercise.
- **course_id**: Identifier for the course to which the exercise belongs.
- **title**: Title of the exercise.
- **type**: Type of the exercise (e.g., "programming", "text", "modeling").
- **max_points**: Maximum points achievable for the exercise.
- **bonus_points**: Bonus points achievable for the exercise.
- **problem_statement**: Detailed description of the problem to be solved.
- **grading_instructions**: Instructions on how the exercise should be graded (can also be `null` in favor of structured grading instructions, i.e. `grading_criteria`).
- **grading_criteria**: Structured grading instructions on how the exercise should be graded (are not required)
- **solution_repository_uri**: URI for the solution repository (for programming exercises).
- **template_repository_uri**: URI for the template repository (for programming exercises).
- **tests_repository_uri**: URI for the tests repository (for programming exercises).
- **meta**: Additional metadata for the exercise.
- **submissions**: List of submissions for the exercise.
