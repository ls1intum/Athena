Analyzing Results
======================

After conducting an experiment, follow these steps to analyze the results:

1. **Export Results:**
    - Export the results, manual ratings, and automatic evaluations from the Conduct Experiment section.

2. **Review Generated Feedback:**
    - Compare module-generated feedback with historical tutor feedback.
    - Quantitative analysis of the module's performance is available in the exported data.

3. **Visualize and Continue Analysis:**
    - Import the results into other tools for further analysis and visualization.
    - You can also continue the experiment at a later time by re-importing the data.
