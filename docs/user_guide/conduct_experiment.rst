Conducting an Experiment
=============================

To conduct an experiment in the Athena Playground, follow these steps:

1. **Define Experiment:**
    - Scroll to the Evaluation Mode section.
    - In "Define Experiments", choose execution modes, exercise types, and manage training and evaluation data.
    - Alternatively, import an experiment configuration using the "Import" button.
    - When done, press "Define Experiment".
    - Export the experiment configuration using the "Export" button for future reference.

2. **Configure Modules:**
    - Select and configure the modules you wish to include in your experiment.
    - Ensure each module is set up with appropriate parameters for effective comparison.
    - Import module configurations using the "Import" button, if needed.
    - Export the module configurations using the "Export" button for future reference.

3. **Conduct Experiment:**
    - Press "Start Experiment" to begin the experiment.
    - The steps performed include sending submissions, sending feedback for training submissions, generating feedback suggestions, and running automatic evaluations.
    - If training submissions are provided, you will need to manually continue the experiment by pressing "Continue".
    - If automatic evaluations is enabled, for instance LLM-as-a-judge for text exercises, you will also need to manually confirm it.
    - Export and import the experiment results as needed using the "Export" and "Import" buttons, respectively.

4. **Annotate Feedback Suggestions:**
    - Annotate the generated feedback suggestions with "Accept" or "Reject" as a tutor would.

5. **Export Results:**
    - At the end of the experiment, or at any time during the experiment, export the results using the "Export" button.
    - Make sure that you also exported the experiment configuration and module configurations to have a complete record of the experiment.
