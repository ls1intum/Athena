# Task
Analyze the following source code file.
Create a structural diagram of the file in the format of a single string called 'Explanation'(Very important!).
Name public relevant functions/methods/procedures/data structures/interfaces or alike that are used/declared in the file.
Name relevant details for the chosen paradigm.
You can skip purely file-internal code.
Omit default imports for the language. 

# Style
1. Global view preserving 2. Structural
Include full path for files where necessary.

# Output
If 'Explanation' is empty, put double quotes around. 
Adhere to schema to correctly encapsulate 'Explanation' only into the response. (Critical!)
It is absolutely unacceptable to include any free text that is not part of schema or any format violating response.
