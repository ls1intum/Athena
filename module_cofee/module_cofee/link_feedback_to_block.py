"""
Text Feedbacks are not inherently linked to a text block.
This is because the feedbacks are just specified by a start and end index.
This means that a feedback can be given on a text block, but also on a part of a text block.
because of that, we need to link feedbacks to text blocks, to find out which feedbacks are given on which text blocks
more easily later on, when creating feedback suggestions.
